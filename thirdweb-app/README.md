# Bike Rental Platform (MVP)

## Phase 1: MVP Implementation

### Smart Contract Development

#### Core Contract Structure

- **Bike struct**: Represents a single bicycle on the platform, storing details like owner, model, year, etc.
- **Review struct**: Represents a review left by a user for a specific bike, including review text, rating, and reviewer address.
- **Product struct**: Represents a product (e.g., bicycle accessories) sold on the platform, storing product details like name, description, price, etc.
- **BikeDetails struct**: Additional details about a bike, such as condition, location, etc.
- **BikeMetadata struct**: Metadata related to a bike, like images, specifications, etc.

#### Additional Functions

- **`transferBikeOwnership`**: Allows the current owner of a bike to transfer ownership to a new user.
- **`mintBikeNFT`**: Mints a new bike NFT and associates it with the owner.
- **`flagBikeAsStolen`**: Marks a bike as stolen, preventing it from being listed for sale.
- **`unflagBikeAsStolen`**: Removes the stolen flag from a bike.
- **`verifyBikeOwnership`**: Checks if a user is the owner of a specific bike.

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Initialize the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
   npx hardhat
   ```

2. **Configure for Base Sepolia**:
   - Set up environment variables (.env):
     ```
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
     ```

3. **Deploy to Base Sepolia**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.tsx --network base-sepolia
   ```

### Testing Framework

- **Create Test Directory Structure**:
  ```
  test/
  ├── bike-listing.test.tsx
  ├── ownership.test.tsx
  ├── reviews.test.tsx
  └── transactions.test.tsx
  ```

### Frontend Development

1. **Set Up React Project with thirdweb**:
   - Initialize the React project using thirdweb for seamless blockchain integration.

2. **Implement Core Components**:
   - `BikeList.tsx`, `BikeDetails.tsx`, `ListBikeForm.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`, `TransactionHistory.tsx`

3. **Connect to Base Sepolia Network**:
   - Ensure the frontend is connected to Base Sepolia for interaction with the smart contracts.

### Security Measures

1. **Implement Access Control**:
   - Add necessary access control measures using libraries like Ownable from OpenZeppelin.

2. **Add Emergency Pause Functionality**:
   ```solidity
   function pause() external onlyOwner
   function unpause() external onlyOwner
   ```

3. **Set up Multi-Sig for Admin Functions**:
   - Configure a multi-signature wallet to control critical admin functions for added security.

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct frequent audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the system.

## Deployment Process

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

2. **Testnet Deployment (Base Sepolia)**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.tsx --network base-sepolia
   ```

3. **Contract Verification**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network base-sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Transaction Monitoring**:
   - Set up a system to monitor transactions on Base Sepolia, ensuring smooth operation.

2. **Gas Usage Optimization**:
   - Optimize gas usage to keep costs low during transactions and contract interactions.

3. **Regular Security Updates**:
   - Continuously patch security vulnerabilities as they are discovered and implement updates.

4. **User Feedback Implementation**:
   - Collect and implement feedback from users to improve the platform.
